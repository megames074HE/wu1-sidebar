                <p>Hey,</p>
                <p>I'm Trevor Philips, the guy who started and runs Trevor philips Enterprises, and I'm really interested in the Operations & logistics manager gig at your company. I've spent years handling though, crucial operations in crazy fast paced situations basically moving stuff around and keeping teams on track. I'm defintely up for a challenge. </p>
                <p>I've tackled some weird businnes issues in my career. Whether it's fixing deliveries when stuff hits the van, or getting a bummed out team back in the game. I always get big results! I lead with being upfront and with a ton of energy.</p>
                <p>Before this I was running Trevor Philips Enterprises, taking care of operations on the ground, in the air and on the sea. I sorted out supply chains in difficult markets and managed client chats, that sometimes required... persuasion. Being an Air Force pilot taught me to be disciplined, how to quickly change plans, and to think straight when things get hectic.</p>
                <p>I think I'd bring energy, fresh ideas and a get it done attitude to your company. I'm solid at business, understanding tactics and can be a bit unpredictable, so i really think i can help your team out.</p>
                <p>Thanks for checking out my application. I can do an interview whenever you want in person, over the phone or even at this airstrip i know by the desert.</p>
                <p>Have a good one,</p>
                <p>Trevor Philips</p>
