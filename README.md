# Trevor Philips Cv and Application letter

There are 2 files index.html and application.html. Index.html contains everything for the cv. And application.html contains everything for the application letter

## Colors used

I mainly used the colors gray white and black. these colors give out a proffesional calm bussines feeling. It doesn't look messy with these colors. It makes everything easier to read.

## font

The font for Trevor's name is the original gta 5 font "pricedown" imported by file. This is meant as a fun easter egg. The rest of the pages uses fonts like "Zalando Sans SemiExpanded" for the titles, "Montserrat" is used for the rest of the page content. This is a calm easy to read font. All of the fonts but pricedown are imported with google fonts.

## picture

The picture used is Trevor himself standing infront of an burning house, that was one of his contract missions. The picture has an white round border around it. That border is made with the css tags: 
    border-radius: 50%; 
    border-style: solid; 
    border-color: white; 

## layout

The layout is inspired by this canva design: https://www.canva.com/sv_se/mallar/EAD7AyxbE7k-gr-minimalistisk-foto-sk-despeleri-cv/. This design uses simple colors and shapes. Just to make it look simple and easy to read.
